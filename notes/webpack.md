## Modules

# Asset Menagement

Prior to webpack, front-end developers would use tools like grunt and gulp to process these assets and move them from their /src folder into their /dist or /build directory. The same idea was used for JavaScript modules, but tools like webpack will dynamically bundle all dependencies (creating what's known as a dependency graph). This is great because every module now explicitly states its dependencies and we'll avoid bundling modules that aren't in use.
